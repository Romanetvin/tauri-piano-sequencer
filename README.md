## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Rust** 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **macOS** (Apple Silicon or Intel)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the piano-player directory:
```bash
cd piano-player
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will:
- Start the Vite dev server
- Compile the Rust backend
- Launch the desktop application with hot reload

### Building for Production

Build the application bundle:
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The compiled app will be available in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

### Creating Notes
1. Select a track from the track panel
2. Click and drag on the piano roll grid to create a note
3. Drag notes to change pitch or timing
4. Drag note edges to adjust duration
5. Click to select notes, Delete/Backspace to remove

### Playing Music
- **Play/Pause**: Click transport controls or press Spacebar
- **Stop**: Returns playback to start
- **Seek**: Click anywhere on the timeline to jump to that position

### Real-Time Keyboard
- Press keys on your QWERTY keyboard to play piano notes
- Visual feedback shows which keys are active
- See the keyboard guide (music note icon) for key mappings

### Managing Tracks
1. Click the tracks icon (‚â°) to open track panel
2. Add/remove tracks
3. Adjust tempo, volume, mute, and solo per track
4. Each track can have different tempo for polyrhythmic compositions

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server (frontend only)
- `npm run tauri dev` - Start full Tauri development environment
- `npm run build` - Build frontend (TypeScript + Vite)
- `npm run tauri build` - Build production application

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 19.1 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- @tauri-apps/api for Rust communication

**Backend:**
- Tauri 2.x for native application framework
- Rust with rodio for audio synthesis
- serde for JSON serialization
- chrono for timestamps

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Spacebar** | Play/Pause |
| **Delete/Backspace** | Remove selected notes |
| **Escape** | Clear selection |
| **QWERTY keys** | Play piano notes (see keyboard guide) |

## Configuration

### Grid Settings
Adjust in `App.tsx`:
```typescript
gridSettings: {
  snapToGrid: true,        // Enable grid snapping
  gridDivision: 4,         // 4 = quarter notes
  pixelsPerBeat: 80,       // Horizontal zoom
  noteHeight: 20,          // Vertical spacing
}
```

### Audio Settings
Modify in `src-tauri/src/audio.rs`:
- ADSR envelope parameters
- Harmonic overtones for piano mode
- Sample rate (default: 44100 Hz)

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing
- Check system volume and permissions
- Ensure no other audio applications are blocking the audio device
- Try switching between Piano and Synthesizer modes

### Build Failures
- Ensure Rust is up to date: `rustup update`
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Clear Rust build cache: `cd src-tauri && cargo clean`

### Port Already in Use
The Vite dev server uses port 1420. If blocked:
- Stop other instances: `lsof -ti:1420 | xargs kill -9`
- Or change the port in `vite.config.ts` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
